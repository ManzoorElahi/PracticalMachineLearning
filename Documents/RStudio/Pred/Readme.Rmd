The input data consisted of various movement measurments including acceleration components of the arms and pitch and roll orientations of the dumbell.

The original data was taken from the originating study linked below. Please see the site and associated paper for more information.

The caret package is used, which provides an interface into a variety of machine learning methods.

## Code


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(knitr)

training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
set.seed(19)
# Coloumns with incomplete data is removed from the training set
na_test = sapply(training, function(x) {sum(is.na(x))})
bad_columns = names(na_test[na_test==19216])
training = training[, !names(training) %in% bad_columns]
# In the below method, cross validation has been performed by 
# dividing the traing data into two folds.
cvCtrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 2, allowParallel = FALSE, verboseIter = TRUE)
m1 = train(classe ~., method="rf", data=training, trControl = cvCtrl)

pred1 <- predict(m1,newdata=testing)

pred1

answers <- pred1

pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(answers)

```

## The final prediction is : 
    B,A,B,A,A,E,D,B,A,A,B,C,B,A,E,E,A,B,B,B
